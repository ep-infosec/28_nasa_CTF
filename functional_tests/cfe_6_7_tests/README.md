The `cfs_6_7_tests` provide example scripts for testing the cFS framework and apps. 

The scripts provided do not perform valid "behavioral" checks, but instead provide examples creating library scripts ("libs/") to verify app-specific requirements as functions, and then invoking these functions with the app-specific test script.
