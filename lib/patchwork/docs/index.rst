Roadmap
=======

While Patchwork has been released with a major version number to signal
adherence to semantic versioning, it's still early in development and has not
fully achieved its design vision yet.

We expect it to gain maturity in tandem with the adoption and development of
Fabric 2. It's also highly likely that Patchwork will see a few major releases
as its API (and those of its sister library, `invocations
<https://invocations.readthedocs.io>`_) matures.
